Today I was reading an article that I found on Hacker News about ways to help stop procrastinating.

On another tab in my Firefox browser I was listening to a TEDx Talk that I randomly clicked on out of boredom. 

Right then it hit me. "I'm reading an article about how not to procrastinate while watching a video that is the king of procrastination."

There's nothing wrong with the content of TEDx Talks but it's this illusion 
that somehow watching these videos will improve your life in some way.

No. You wont become a millionaire by watching a one hour talk by a millionaire.

Why? Because you have to set achievable goals that you actually want to accomplish. And goals are not accomplished by watching a TEDx talk.

These videos give off the impression that there's an easy route for anything. WRONG.   

If you want to do something then set a goal with a deadline. And stick to that goal no matter what.
