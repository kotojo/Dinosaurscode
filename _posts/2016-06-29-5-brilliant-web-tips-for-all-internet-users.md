### Tip 1: Google Search

Most things you search for are outdated. 

Clicking "Search tools" gives options to search by time.

### Tip 2: More Youtube Content

If you find yourself craving new content simply search what's trending in other countries.

Scroll to the very bottom and click "Country" after which you'll have a brand new Popular Right Now list.

### Tip 3: Build Your Own Website

Your opinion matters and others deserve to hear it.

The simplest and free method I would recommend is building a blog on [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com)

Or you could give a shot at setting WordPress up on your own server in [this article](https://dinosaurscode.xyz/tips/2016/06/15/how-to-build-a-web-server/)

### Tip 4: Use API's 

> API is a fancy word for saying "Here's our data take it and do what you want with it."

Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google, and many more big websites allow you to manage your data programatically.

If you want to write a program to send email for you, follow [this tutorial](http://localhost:4000/go/2016/06/21/sending-email-using-golang/), but make sure to install the [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) programming language first.

### Tip 5: Use Password Managers  

Memorizing passwords for each website you sign up for is a big no no.

Password managers store your passwords encrypted and also handle creating super hard to guess/brute force passwords.
