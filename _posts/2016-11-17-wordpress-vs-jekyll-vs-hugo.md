When in comes to blogging Wordpress is now competing with the popular static site generators Jekyll and Hugo. But which is best?

Let's start with the behemoth that is Wordpress.

### Things to hate about it

* You'll be paying monthly for a web server.  

* Maintaining the database is a hassle (backing up). 

* Server can be hacked. 

* PHP 

### Things to love about it

* Most vendors have a one click install button. 

* Plugins make hard stuff easy (SEO, HTTPS, etc..).

* Switching between themes is a breeze.  

* Very powerful in the right hands.

### Things to hate about it

* Steep learning curve. Although the [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) have everything you'll need for help.

* Ruby must be installed (a pain) on your local computer. Personally I use [rvm](https://rvm.io/).

* Very slow at reloading new content.

* No database means no comment section. Unless you use a third party such as Disqus. 

### Things to love about it

* Easy to manage once you get the basics down (theming, config files, deployment).  

* Free hosting on [Github Pages](https://dinosaurscode.xyz/how-to/2016/06/24/blog-using-jekyll-and-github-pages/). 

* This very website is built on Jekyll!

### Things to hate about it

* Not many prebuilt (or good) themes so expect to be in the [docs](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/).

* You'll have to install and learn some [Go](https://golang.org/). 

* Learning curve is pretty steep, but luckily I've made a beginner friendly [tutorial](https://dinosaurscode.xyz/tutorials/2016/07/25/hugo-static-site-generator-tutorial/).

### Things to love about it

* Extremely fast at building your project.

* Switching themes is pretty easy.

* Free hosting on Github Pages.

* Simpler than Jekyll but harder than Wordpress. 

### Conclusion 

All three options are great but if you're on a budget then Jekyll or Hugo will be the best option.

Stick with Wordpress if you don't want to learn Github, programming, or need something done quickly and easily.
