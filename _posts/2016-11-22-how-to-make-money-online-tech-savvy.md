### Twitch

So this one's really fun since you get to play games and make a living. 

The popular website [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/) lets you stream gameplay and make money through ads and subscriptions. 

Simply download [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/categories/obs-studio-plugins.6/) (for streaming), install [League of Legends](http://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US) (free game), and build a following.

### Youtube

Probably the simplest way to earn big bucks is through Youtube adsense.

Simply create great content that receives lots of views. 

Some excellent software to create videos are After Effects, Sony Vegas, Photoshop, Audacity, and Adobe Flash.

Got interesting things to talk about? Then create a blog and share your thoughts with the world.

Eventually, when you get enough viewers, you can add ads through Google Adsense.

### Surveys

Probably the least fun, but you'll definitely make a few extra dollars doing is taking surveys.

They pay cheap and take a bit of time to complete but eventually they add up to a nice paycheck.

Most will pay you through Paypal or gift cards. 

[Opinonoutpost](https://www.opinionoutpost.com/) is one I've personally tried and got paid through Paypal. But I'm sure there are many more.

### Craigslist and Ebay

Selling your things should be the last resort, but if you need quick money then Ebay and Craiglist are great sites to sell your items.

Ebay will take a cut from your sell so it's probably best to try Craigslist first.

Kijiji for Canadians of course. 

### Freelance

Knowing HTML and CSS could get you a gig building websites for people.

### Software 

Lastly there's software. If you can code then build something that others would pay for.

I hear that Minecraft guy is a billionaire now.
