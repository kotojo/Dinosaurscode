So I'm just going to get this out of the way and say there is no best text editor. Why? Because they
each serve their purpose differently.

Nonetheless here are my favorites in order.

### 1. [Atom](https://atom.io/)
Atom has the best looking GUI, in my opinion. Tons of packages.

I use [markdown preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) to preview github README's before pushing. [Emmet](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) for quick html creation.

### 2. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
Sublime has the same features as Atom but less performance. It's noticeably slower in my opinion.

### 3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
So this editor is quite similar to Atom because they're both built on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). Electron is
a way to build cross platform applications using html/css/js. This makes them extremely fast.

### 4. [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
I only use vim to edit files over [ssh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell). It's by far the fastest as it needs no GUI and it's great if you have the time to learn it.

### 5. [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
Emacs is powerful in the right hands. I don't use it often but I know its extremely useful. Heck you can browse the web in it and send email and play chess in it!

### 6. [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
Brackets is another one of those cross platform css/js applications. It should be fast but I haven't seen that. Perhaps it's great but not for me.
