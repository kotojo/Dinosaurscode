Too many websites focus only on [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) and leave the reader with a wall of useless text and images.

### Tip 1: Write Down Ideas 

Jotting down ideas can help you come up with many blog post ideas.   

Keep the one that you really want to write about and store the rest for later.

### Tip 2: Never Be Outside the Loop 

Readers don't enjoy reading old news. Make sure you're up to date with whatever your niche is.

Never be outside the loop by using [Google Trends]().

### Tip 3: Post Daily  

Readers WILL come back to your site expecting new content.  

Not only does new daily content help grow your site, but it also keeps the users you already have coming back for more.

If you're serious about blogging, don't neglect your blog. 

### Tip 4: Make Great Titles

A well thought out title can bring lots of readers to your blog post.

Make sure it's relevant to the content and keep it simple.

### Tip 5: Blog About What You Love 

> Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.

You've heard that quote before right? Well it's true.

Blogging about what you love will be fun for you and the reader. You gain readers by writing for them. 

Make sure it's something you truly care about.
