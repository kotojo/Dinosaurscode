I decided to put a couple of websites under Google's [PageSpeed Test](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) and was astonished at the results I found!

# First up is [Forbes](forbes.com)

Fails.

# Second up is [Buzzfeed](buzzfeed.com)

And the king of clickbait fails.

# Third up [CNN](cnn.com)

Fails. No surprise there considering they get their news from Reddit.

# Fourth [Reddit](reddit.com)

Speaking of Reddit they fail too.

# Last but not least is my website

PASSED!
