A must watch for every programmer is this video **"The Future of Programming"** by **Bob Martin**. 

<!--more-->

He eloquently goes through the history of computers and computer programming in a simple manner.

Some issues he discusses are the gender gap, why so many languages, and what it really means to be a programmer. 

Definitely worth watching all the way through.
